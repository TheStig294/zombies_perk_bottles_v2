# TTT/2 CoD Zombies Perk Bottles

## Credit goes to [Hagen](https://steamcommunity.com/id/HagenKL) for creating the [original mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=842302491)

"Perk bottle" items for Gmod TTT! These items give a passive buff on purchase, available to detectives and traitors.\
\
In this edited version, Juggernog grants +50% health and Stamin-up now works again.\
You can turn on/off perks for the detective or traitor, and adjust their effects.\
\
Many bugs and issues have been fixed, such as not receiving a perk when you try to buy one, even though you used up a credit, if something is trying to block it like the "Harpooooon!" randomat.\
\
Each bottle now explains its effect in chat when you drink it, and there are now convars for turning a perk off/on for a role or adjusting the effects of the perks (see below).
